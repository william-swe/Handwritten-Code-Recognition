Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
public class SimilarExam6 {
    public double test1() {
        double result = 0.
        for(int i=0; i<1; i++) {
            system.out.println(i);
        }
        return result;
    }

public class SimilarExam12 {
    public void test2() {
        for(int j=0; j<10; j++) {
            j += 1;
        return j; }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Double> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
