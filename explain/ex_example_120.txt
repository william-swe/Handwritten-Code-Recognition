On line 1, I see "import java.util.ArrayList;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 2, I see "public class SumArrayList {", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 3, I see "public sumArrayList(ArrayList<? extends Number>) {". I see two carets on this line:
 - One is a downward caret between "public" and "sumArrayList". There is a text "static Double" right above the caret, so I insert "static Double" between "public" and "sumArrayList".
 - Another is an upward caret below "Number>". There is a text "numsArr" right below the caret, so I insert "numsArr" right after "Number>".
Hence, the final text on this line would be: "public static Double sumArrayList(ArrayList<? extends Number> numsArr) {".
On line 4, I see "T sum = 0;" so I transcribe it as is.
On line 5, I see "for(T num=numsArr) {", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 6, I see "sum += num.doubleValue();", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 7, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 8, I see "return sum;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 9, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is.
I reach the end of the image. I see that there is a syntax error as there should be a closing bracket for the class, but I ignore it because the instruction says never correct syntax mistakes.

Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class SumArrayList {
    public static Double sumArrayList(ArrayList<? extends Number> numsArr) {
        T sum = 0;
        for(T num=numsArr) {
            sum += num.doubleValue();
        }
        return sum;
    }
