On line 1, I see "Line 9: constructor doesn't need to return types.", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 2, I see "public Liquid(T LiquidType, P LiquidPrice) {", so I transcribe it as is. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.
On line 3, I see "Line 30: wrong types of comparison", so I transcribe it as is. At first, I see a crossout after the word "Line" and there is a number "30" above it, so I replace the crossout with "30". I do the same for the word "comparison".
On line 4, I see "for(Liquid<T,P> l: barrel) {" so I transcribe it as is. I see a crossout and the text "<T,P>" right above it, so I replace the crossout with the text. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.
On line 5, I see a strikethough text, so I ignore it.
On line 6, I see "if(l.liquidType == liquidType) {", so I transcribe it as is. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.
On line 7, I see "barrel.remove(1);", so I transcribe it as is. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.
On line 8, I see "return liquidType + " sold.";", so I transcribe it as is. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.
On line 9, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is. I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.

On line 13, I see a new line, so I add a line break.

I notice some spaces before the text, so I indent the text as is.

Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
Line 9: constructor doesn't need to return types.
        public Liquid(T LiquidType, P LiquidPrice) {

Line 30: wrong types of comparison
            for(Liquid<T,P> l: barrel) {
                if(l.liquidType == liquidType) {
                    barrel.remove(1);
                    return liquidType + " sold.";
                }
            }

Line 38: miss the return type
            public void checkStorage() {

Line 23: miss the new keyword
         Liquid<T,P> l = new Liquid<T,P>(type, price);
