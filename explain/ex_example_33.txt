On line 1, I see "import java.util.*;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 2, I see "public class sumArrayList {", so I transcribe it as is. I see a strikethough text on this line, so I ignore it.

On line 9, I see a strikethough text, so I ignore it.
On line 10, I see "double sumArrayList(ArrayList <? extends Number>) {" so I transcribe it as is. I see a strikethough text on this line, and the word "numbers" right above the strikethough text, so I replace the strikethough text with "numbers", so the method becomes "double sumArrayList(ArrayList <? extends Number> numbers) {".
Right below line 10, I see an arrow indicating an insertion, and a text "double result = 0;" next to it, so I insert the text "double result = 0;" as line 11.
On line 12, I see "for(Number number: numbers) {" so I transcribe it as is.
On line 13, I see "number = (double) number;" so I transcribe it as is.

On line 16, I see "return result;" so I transcribe it as is.
On line 17, I see "}" so I transcribe it as is.
Even though there is a syntax error (the class should be closed with a closing brace), I ignore it because the instruction says never correct syntax errors.
On line 18, I see "// look another page" so I transcribe it as is.

Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
import java.util.*;

public class sumArrayList {
    double sumArrayList(ArrayList <? extends Number> numbers){
        double result = 0;
        for (Number number: numbers) {
            number = (double) number;
            result += number;
        }
        return result;
    }
