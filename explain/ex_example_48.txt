On line 1, I see "public static void main(String[] args) {", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 2, I see "SumArrayList<Integer> numbers = new SumArrayList<>();", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 3, I see a strikethough text, so I ignore it.
On line 4, I see "numbers.add(1);", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 5, I see "numbers.add(2);", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 6, I see "numbers.add(3);", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 7, I see "numbers.add(4);", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 8, I see a strikethough text, so I ignore it.
On line 9, I see a strikethough text, so I ignore it.
On line 10, I see "String result = f(%.2f, numbers.sumArrayList());", so I transcribe it as is. I then note that there is a caret ("v") indicating an insertion, and there is a text "(float)" right above the caret, so I insert the text "(float)" into "String result = f(%.2f, numbers.sumArrayList());", so it becomes: "String result = f(%.2f, (float) numbers.sumArrayList());".
On line 11, I see "System.out.println(result);", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 12, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 13, I see a redundant "}", but I include it because the instruction says never correct syntax errors.

Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SumArrayList<Integer> numbers = new SumArrayList<>();
    numbers.add(1);
    numbers.add(2);
    numbers.add(3);
    numbers.add(4);
    String result = f(%.2f, (float) numbers.sumArrayList());
    System.out.println(result);
}
}
