On line 1, I see "import java.util.List;", so I transcribe it as is. I see a strikethough text right before the line, so I ignore it.
On line 2, I see "import java.util.ArrayList;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 3, I see "import java.util.*;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 4, I see that there is no code, so I add a blank line.
On line 5, I see "public class SumArrayList {" so I transcribe it as is.
On line 6, I see "public <? extends Number> double sumArrayList(List<T> AL) {", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 7, I see "double result = 0;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 8, I see "List<iterator> Iterator = AL.iterator().", so I transcribe it as is. Even though there is a syntax error ("." should be replaced by a semicolon), I ignore it because the instruction says never correct syntax errors.
On line 9, I see a strikethough line, so I ignore it.
On line 10, I see a strikethough line, so I ignore it.
On line 11, I see "while(Iterator.hasNext()) {", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 12, I see "result += Iterator.doubleVanle();", so I transcribe it as is. Even though there is a typo ("doubleVanle" should be "doubleValue"), I ignore it because the instruction says never correct typos.
On line 13, I see "Iterator.remove()", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 14, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 15, I see "return result;", so I transcribe it as is.
On line 16, I see "}", so I transcribe it as is. I see that there is a syntax error as there should be a closing bracket for the class, but I ignore it because the instruction says never correct syntax errors.

Putting things together, the final code is:
<answer>
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.*;

public class SumArrayList {
    public <? extends Number> double sumArrayList(List<T> AL) {
    double result = 0;
    List<iterator> Iterator = AL.iterator(),

    while(Iterator.hasNext()) {
        result += Iterator.doubleVaule();
        Iterator.remove();
    }
    return result;
}
